I felt that turning 20% of all soil items (on average - each soil item has a 1 in 5 chance)
into weeds made the game quite challenging. My custom features allow the user to make the game as easy
or difficult as they wish.

They can set their own starting balance, from $5 - $100. They can also select
the overall difficulty of weed transformation on each till, easy is 10% probability,
medium is 20% probability and hard is 30% probability.

They also have an option to use a turn to spray pesticide around the field which
will kill 10% of all weeds and turn them into untilled soil.
